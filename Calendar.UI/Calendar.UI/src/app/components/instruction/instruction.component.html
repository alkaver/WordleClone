    <h1>How to Play Wordle</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Wordle! The goal of the game is to guess a hidden 5-letter word within 6 attempts. Here's how it works:</p>

    <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You have 6 attempts to guess the correct word.</li>
        <li>Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.</li>
        <li>After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tile Colors Explained</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The hidden word is "CRANE".</p>
        <p>You guess: "CLOUD".</p>
        <p>
            <span class="correct">C</span>
            <span class="absent">L</span>
            <span class="absent">O</span>
            <span class="absent">U</span>
            <span class="absent">D</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="correct">Green</span>: The letter <strong>C</strong> is in the correct position.</li>
            <li><span class="absent">Gray</span>: The letters <strong>L, O, U, D</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        <p>You guess: "CRATE".</p>
        <p>
            <span class="correct">C</span>
            <span class="correct">R</span>
            <span class="present">A</span>
            <span class="absent">T</span>
            <span class="absent">E</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="correct">Green</span>: The letters <strong>C</strong> and <strong>R</strong> are in the correct positions.</li>
            <li><span class="present">Yellow</span>: The letter <strong>A</strong> is in the word but in the wrong position.</li>
            <li><span class="absent">Gray</span>: The letters <strong>T</strong> and <strong>E</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Start with words that contain common vowels (e.g., A, E, I, O, U).</li>
        <li>Use the feedback from each guess to eliminate possibilities.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to the position of letters marked in green or yellow.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Good luck, and have fun playing Wordle!</p>
